SwingEMA Pro is a precision trading tool designed for traders who thrive on clean structure, trend alignment, and disciplined risk management. Built in Pine Script v5, this indicator blends two core market elements — trend confirmation with EMAs and market structure swings — into a single framework. It doesn’t just point entries; it carries trades through to risk-defined exits and take-profit tracking, giving both clarity and confidence in execution.

Key Highlights:

Dual EMA Engine (Fast & Slow): Instantly spots trend bias with crossover detection for bullish and bearish momentum.

Swing Highs & Lows: Dynamically maps market structure with visual swing lines for context and breakout validation.

Smart Entry Triggers: Entries confirm only when price aligns with both trend and swing structure, reducing false signals.

Risk-Reward Boxes: Automatically draws trade boxes showing stop-loss, entry, and take-profit zones with adjustable RR ratio.

Auto TP & Exit Labels: Marks trades with ✅ TP or ❌ Exit the moment price reaches key levels.

Date Range Filters: Backtest with precision by limiting signals within chosen start and end dates.

Visual Clarity: Clean plots, swing rays, and RR boxes — making execution faster without overloading the chart.

This isn’t just another crossover or swing script — it’s a complete trade workflow on the chart: structure, trend, entry, RR, and outcome, all automated and visually tracked.
